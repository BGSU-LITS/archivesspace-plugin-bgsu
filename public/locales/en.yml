      <p>Please note that we are still transferring our finding aids to this
      site. As we do so, we encourage you to also search our
      <a href="https://lib.bgsu.edu/finding_aids/">legacy Finding Aids
      site</a>. If you have further questions, please contact the appropriate
      <a href="/findingaids/repositories">repository</a>.</p>
    requesting_head: Requesting Materials
    requesting_message: |
      <p>Each finding aid contains a link to request materials from the
      collections. Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for
      providing access to its collections. Please consult the
      <a href="/findingaids/repositories">repository</a> with questions about
      using the materials. Please note that collections are non-circulating and
      must be used in the repository’s reading room. In some cases the
      collections are stored off-site and require advance notice for retrieval.
      While some finding aids link to digitized versions of select collection
      items, viewing a collection in its entirety will require visiting the
      repository.</p>
