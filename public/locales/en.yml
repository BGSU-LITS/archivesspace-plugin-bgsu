      <p>Please note that we are still transferring our finding aids to this
      site. As we do so, we encourage you to also search our
      <a href="https://lib.bgsu.edu/finding_aids/">legacy Finding Aids site</a>.
      If you have further questions, please contact the appropriate
      <a href="/archives/repositories">repository</a>.</p>
    requesting_head: Requesting Materials
    requesting_message: |
      <p>Each finding aid contains a link to request materials from the
      collections. Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for
      providing access to its collections. Please consult the
      <a href="/archives/repositories">repository</a> with questions about using
      the materials. Please note that collections are non-circulating and must
      be used in the repository’s reading room. In some cases the collections
      are stored off-site and require advance notice for retrieval. While some
      finding aids link to digitized versions of select collection items,
      viewing a collection in its entirety will require visiting the
      repository.</p>
