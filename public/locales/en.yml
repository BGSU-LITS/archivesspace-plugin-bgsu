    finding_message: |
      <p>We are still in the process of making all our collection finding aids
      available on this site. If you’re not finding what you’re looking for
      here, we encourage you to search our comprehensive
      <a href="https://lib.bgsu.edu/finding_aids/">legacy Finding Aids site</a>,
      which still contains the entirety of our collection finding aids and will
      remain available until the migration to this site has been completed. If
      you still cannot locate a particular finding aid or have any further
      questions regarding information about our collections, please contact the
      appropriate <a href="/archives/repositories">repository</a>.</p>
    requesting_head: Requesting Materials
    requesting_message: |
      <p>Each finding aid contains a link to request materials from the
      collections. Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for
      providing access to its collections. Please consult the
      <a href="/archives/repositories">repository</a> with questions about using
      the materials. Please note that collections are non-circulating and must
      be used in the repository’s reading room. In some cases the collections
      are stored off-site and require advance notice for retrieval. While some
      finding aids link to digitized versions of select collection items,
      viewing a collection in its entirety will require visiting the
      repository.</p>
