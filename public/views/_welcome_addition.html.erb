<h2>Requesting Materials</h2>
<p>Each finding aid contains a link to request materials from the collections. Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for providing access to its collections. Please consult the <a href="/findingaids/repositories">repository</a> with questions about using the materials. Please note that collections are non-circulating and must be used in the repository’s reading room. In some cases the collections are stored off-site and require advance notice for retrieval. While some finding aids link to digitized versions of select collection items, viewing a collection in its entirety will require visiting the repository.</p>

<h2>Not Finding What You’re Looking For?</h2>
<p>Please note that we are still transferring our finding aids to this site. As we do so, we encourage you to also search our <a href="https://lib.bgsu.edu/finding_aids/">legacy Finding Aids site</a>. If you have further questions, please contact the appropriate <a href="/findingaids/repositories">repository</a>.</p>
